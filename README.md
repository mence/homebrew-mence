# homebrew-mence

Custom [Homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core) installs to restore removed or deprecated applications from the upstream [Homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew) and Caskroom repositories.

As Caskroom does not provide a description for it's Casks, I've added a small description for some of the apps below.

**WARNING: No warranty is implied in these apps, nor is there any support for them.**

## [Kegs (command-line applications)](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core)

- [`cputhrottle`](http://www.willnolan.com/cputhrottle/cputhrottle.html): a small OS X command-line utility designed to limit the CPU usage of a process to which it attaches.
- [`pdf-react-tools`](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/pdf-redact-tools): PDF redaction and metadata removal tool
- [`unrar`](https://www.rarlab.com/): RAR archive tool

## Casks (GUI applications)

### [Applications](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask)

#### Command-Line Applications

* [Day One CLI](https://dayoneapp.com/tools/cli-man): Day One Classic’s command line interface tool (yes, I am aware that it is strange that this is managed as a Cask not a Keg. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`)

* [Polar Clock](http://blog.pixelbreaker.com/polarclock): This innovative clock screensaver from PixelBreaker displays both the time (hours, minutes and seconds) and the date (weekday, day of the month, and month) of the current year in a circular fashion, with each circle representing one division of time.
